## Hi 👋
My name is Shantanu Rathore. I also go by Shan. 
I am a Data Analyst by profession. I started my journey in Software Engineering. Pursued an MBA hoping to get into consulting but on my journey I doscovered the field of Data Analytics/Business Intelligence and how impactful it is. I am not limited to just analyzing data. I also find Data Engineering fascinating and equally powerful. I eventually want to transition into Data Science. 

🔭 I’m currently working on implementing [DBT](www.getdbt.com) on my local machine and the cloud.<br>
🔭 Deep Diving into Linear Regression and its applications<br>

🌱 I am learning how to implement Machine Learning Projects on the cloud<br>
🌱 Building programs which can leverage LLMs to analyze and categorize text data<br>
